# Principles-of-Web-Application-Security

In this Project, we provided our entire web security project in which we analyzed our web applications on critical vulnerabilities and implemented them practically. 
After building a vulnerable skincare beauty site, we proceeded to deliberately hack it and availed the exploit methods (five major exploit techniques of XSS, SQL Injection, LFI, Brute-Force, and IDOR) 
and mitigation strategies effectively. 
The project used tester tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Fiddler 
to test the penetrability and traffic analysis of the project in conjunction with locally developed high-level PHP coding and JavaScript coding 
to simulate the portrayal of the vulnerability as well as security countermeasures.
