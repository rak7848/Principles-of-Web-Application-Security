# Principles-of-Web-Application-Security

In this Project, we provided our entire web security project in which we analyzed our web applications on critical vulnerabilities and implemented them practically. 
After building a vulnerable skincare beauty site, we proceeded to deliberately hack it and availed the exploit methods (five major exploit techniques of XSS, SQL Injection, LFI, Brute-Force, and IDOR) 
and mitigation strategies effectively. 
The project used tester tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Fiddler 
to test the penetrability and traffic analysis of the project in conjunction with locally developed high-level PHP coding and JavaScript coding 
to simulate the portrayal of the vulnerability as well as security countermeasures.

Principles of Web Application Security_HW 1-2.docx: The theme of the work is HTTP attacks with the use of proxy tools. We interfered with requests (changing part of the requests to the server, such as headers and HTTP method)2, using Burp Suite, and manipulated cookies with OWASP ZAP, and Fiddler assisted with comparing HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This was aimed at comprehending risks of request tampering.

Homework2 Principles of Web Application Security: This assignment examined browser security policies such as Same-Origin Policy (SOP), Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Content Security Policy (CSP). 
We have created websec.example.com and websec2.example.com virtual hosts on our XAMPP, we were able to modify the DOM with JavaScript and we tried to see what security restrictions browsers can impose.

Principles of Web Application Security_Project-2.docx: In this project a vulnerable web site was constructed, attacked and secured. We used and multiplied bugs such as XSS (stored comments),SQL injection (bypassing login), LFI (accessing files), brute-force (Python script), and IDOR (accessing other profiles impermissibly), and resolved the situation by fixing them using input filtering and hashing passwords.
